:zap: Blazing Fast implementation of the Gibbs Sampling Dirichlet Mixture Model for topic modelling over short texts utilizing the power of :1234: Numpy and :snake: Numba.
<br>The package uses the Movie Group Process algorithm described in Yin and Wang (2014).

## Features

- Fast :zap:
- Scalable :collision:
- High consistency and coherence :dart:
- High quality topics :fire:
- Easy visualization and inspection :eyes:
- Full scikit-learn compatibility :nut_and_bolt:

## 🛠 Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install tweetopic
```

If you intend to use the visualization features of PyLDAvis, install the package with optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install tweetopic[viz]
```

## 👩‍💻 Usage

For easy topic modelling, tweetopic provides you the TopicPipeline class:

```python
from tweetopic import TopicPipeline, DMM
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Creating a vectorizer for extracting document-term matrix from the
# text corpus.
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(min_df=15, max_df=0.1)

# Creating a Dirichlet Mixture Model with 30 components
dmm = DMM(n_clusters=30, n_iterations=100, alpha=0.1, beta=0.1)

# Creating topic pipeline
pipeline = TopicPipeline(vectorizer, dmm)
```

You may fit the model with a stream of short texts:

```python
pipeline.fit(texts)
```

To examine the structure of the topics you can either look at the most frequently occuring words:

```python
pipeline.top_words(top_n=3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[
    {'vaccine': 1011.0, 'coronavirus': 428.0, 'vaccines': 396.0},
    {'afghanistan': 586.0, 'taliban': 509.0, 'says': 464.0},
    {'man': 362.0, 'prison': 310.0, 'year': 288.0},
    {'police': 567.0, 'floyd': 444.0, 'trial': 393.0},
    {'media': 331.0, 'twitter': 321.0, 'facebook': 306.0},
    ...
    {'pandemic': 432.0, 'year': 427.0, 'new': 422.0},
    {'election': 759.0, 'trump': 573.0, 'republican': 527.0},
    {'women': 91.0, 'heard': 84.0, 'depp': 76.0}
]
```

Or use rich visualizations provided by [pyLDAvis](https://github.com/bmabey/pyLDAvis):

```python
pipeline.visualize(texts)
```

## Limitations

tweetopic is so efficient and fast, as it exploits the fact that it's only short texts, we want to cluster. The number of unique terms in any document _MUST_ be less than 256.
Additionally any term in any document may at most appear 255 times.
<br>As of now, this requirement is not enforced by the package, please be aware of this, as it might cause strange behaviour.

> Note: If it is so demanded, this restriction could be relaxed, make sure to file an issue, if you intend to use tweetopic for longer texts.

## Differences from the [gsdmm](https://github.com/rwalk/gsdmm) package

- _tweetopic_ is usually orders of magnitude faster than _gsdmm_ thanks to the clever use of data structures and numba accelarated loops.
  After some surface level benchmarking it seems that in many cases _tweetopic_ performs the same task about 60 times faster.
- _tweetopic_ supports texts where a term occurs multiple times. _gsdmm_ only implements single occurance terms.
- gsdmm is no longer maintained
